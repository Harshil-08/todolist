# To-Do List App

This is a simple to-do list application built using React. The app allows users to add, mark as completed, and delete tasks.

## Features

- Add tasks: Enter a task in the input field and click "Submit" to add it to the to-do list.
- Mark as completed: Click on a task to toggle its completion status. Completed tasks will have a line-through.
- Delete tasks: Click on the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.
- Persistent Storage: The to-do list is stored in the local storage, so your tasks will persist even if you close or refresh the page.
